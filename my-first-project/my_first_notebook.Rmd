# My first R notebook

This notebook is used to document my first adventure into the exciting world of R.

## A simple first plot

R contains some data sources which can be used to play around with. For example the `cars` object. When plotted, it looks like this:

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

## Getting started

First, we will acquire some data.

### Getting data

Here goes the getting data part. We'll simply use `cars` for now. Let's look at the data

```{r}
cars
```

### Transforming data

This is where tidyverse comes in. First we load it.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Now we can only look at cars that have a distance \> 50. Use the `dplyr` package and the `filter` function, store the result in the new variable `count` and print it out.

```{r}
cars %>%
  filter(cars$dist > 50) %>%
  summarise(count = n())
```
